Pong is where two people each control one paddle on a screen. They can only stay on their half of the screen and can only move up and down. There is a dotted line down the middle of the screen. There is a ball that is continuasly moving across the screen. The ball can bounce off of the paddles, but if it hits the wall on one side then the other side gets a point. The game is over after one player gets a certain amount of points.
The ball starts in the middle and the paddles start in the middle of the screen, but not like the middle middle, like the middle of the sides.
The game ends when one player gets 11 points. They would get a you win screen and then play again.
If the ball hits the wall +1 to the player of the opposite wall.
I promise this makes sense in my head.
You will need two paddles that move at the same speed. There has to be a dotted line in the middle for decoration. A moving ball that moves a one speed and can collide with the paddles.
You need positions for everything and speed for everything but the dotted line. People would hate you if it moved. I wanna make it move.
